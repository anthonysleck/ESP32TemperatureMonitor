# ESP32TemperatureMonitor
A simple ESP32 temperature monitor using a DS18B20 temperature sensor. Included is a custom PCB, the code, and the files to connect to an Apache server for web display of data stored on a MYSQL server. The data will show in a clean chart format. There is also a WWW interface to connect to the ESP32. The main page includes a link to the main Github source, a link for updating the ESP32 OTA, and a link to see the realtime data.

Tutorial for setup coming in the future!
